# Algorithm

This algorithm will be pretty straight fordward, will take the same amount of runes required for leveling up in order to give it a try, to avoid farming SSS on early at
the very begining of the game the gatcha will be disabled or just make almost impossible get any weapon better than B tier.

On further versions the gacha will get more complex and add new type of coins completly remove any possibility to get any weapon not beloging to the gacha pool and adding new types 
of weapons or states.

# Types of gacha
    - Ashes of War / Spirit Ashes
